# GCD

ðŸ§® Ladder Method for Finding GCD
The Ladder Method is a simple and visual technique for finding the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) â€” also known as the Greatest Common Factor (GCF) â€” of two or more numbers. It's especially useful for beginners or classroom demonstrations.
ðŸ“Œ How It Works
- Write the numbers side by side.
- Find a common prime factor of all the numbers.
- Divide each number by that factor, and write the results below.
- Repeat the process with the new row until no more common factors remain.
- Multiply all the common prime factors used in the division steps.
The result is the GCD.

âœ… Example: Find GCD of 36 and 60:
36 | 2
60 | 2
-------
18 | 2
30 | 2
-------
9  | 3
15 | 3
-------
3  | Ã—
5  | Ã—
_____________
Common prime factors used: 2, 2, 3
GCD = 2 Ã— 2 Ã— 3 = 12
